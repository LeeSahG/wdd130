        <p>Hello! My name is Lisakhanya Gasa and I am from South Africa, in Eastern Cape in a beautiful 
        little town called King William's Town. I enjoy beautiful music that speaks to the soul and good 
        food. I am a happy member of the Church of Jesus Christ, baptized in February 2021. Since then, I 
        have come to really understand and appreciate the kind of person that I am. I am vey kind, I 
        always aim to try to make another person laugh because I know how rare happy moments can be. I love 
        very hard, because I see how many people hunger for a tender hug or a gentle word. I definitely enjoy 
        laughing. I probably have one of the loudest laughs, and a piggy snort would escape now and again on 
        a very good day. Any fluffy animal is my favorite!</p>

    <p>South Africa is known as the Rainbow Nation, a nickname that was birthed because of the multiple 
        cultures and languages South Africa has. It is also displayed on our National Flag which has colors.</p>
