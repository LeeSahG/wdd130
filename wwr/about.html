    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>We Rafters was founded in 2014 when two students put together their love for adrenaline, adventure, and water, together for a school project which they manifested into an actual business after graduating. Lisakhanya Gasa and Justin Masiza filed in petitions to one of the beautiful and remote areas in the beautiful Eastern Cape to use as a Water Rafting Site in 2014 and their business has boomed since.</p>
